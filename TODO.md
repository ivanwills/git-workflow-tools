* git jira is printing switching twice
* add git where to determine which branches a file has been changed or a person has committed (recently)
* branch-clean - fix --max-age=0 to actually not delete branches not merged to master
* watch - Doesn't really watch remote changes. (set up a remote and local auto committing repo to watch)
* watch - Save state option
* branch-diff - with --merged show the differences of branched merged in the current branch an another
* branch-recreate - recreate a branch by cherry-picking without some commits (is this possible generically?)
    (git show --pretty=%P may help for merge commits)
