* add git where to determine which branches a file has been changed or a person has committed (recently)
* branch-clean - fix --max-age=0 to actually not delete branches not merged to master
* watch - Doesn't really watch remote changes. (set up a remote and local auto committing repo to watch)
* watch - Save state option
